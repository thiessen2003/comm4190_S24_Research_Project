	abstract = {The author provides a comprehensive historical overview of artificial intelligence, tracing its development from the early days of the field to the present. It also discusses the potential for another "AI winter," a period of reduced funding and interest in AI research, and offers insights on how to prevent such a scenario. This paper is particularly relevant to the research as it helps contextualize the development of AI and LLMs, highlighting the importance of avoiding past pitfalls and ensuring the sustainable progress of the field. For the purpose of the research, the paper  is particularly interesting because it not only provides a detailed history of AI but also offers practical recommendations for navigating the challenges and opportunities in the field, which is crucial for researchers and practitioners working on LLMs and other AI technologies.},
