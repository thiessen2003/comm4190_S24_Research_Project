	abstract = {The author investigates how search algorithms can perpetuate and reinforce racial biases, drawing on case studies and analysis of search engine results. The author argues that the biases embedded in these algorithms reflect and amplify societal prejudices and discrimination, leading to the marginalization and oppression of communities of color. This book is relevant to the research work as it highlights the potential for AI systems, including LLMs, to amplify and perpetuate societal biases, emphasizing the need to address these issues in the development and deployment of AI technologies. The paper is particularly important for my research as it exposes the hidden biases in seemingly neutral technologies and underscores the importance of critical examination and accountability in the design and use of AI systems.},
