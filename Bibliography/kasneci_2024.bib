	abstract = {The authors provide a comprehensive overview of the opportunities and challenges associated with the use of large language models, such as ChatGPT, in education. This paper is particularly relevant to my research as it explores the potential benefits of these models for learners and teachers, while also addressing the ethical and practical considerations that must be taken into account when integrating them into educational settings. The authors discuss various applications of large language models, including personalized learning, content creation, and assessment, and highlight the importance of developing students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills alongside the use of these technologies. This paper was particularly relevant to my research mainly because I consider it to be a valuable resource for understanding the current state of research on large language models in education and the key challenges that must be addressed to ensure their effective and ethical use.},
