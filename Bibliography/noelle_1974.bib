	abstract = {Noelle-Neumann introduces the spiral of silence theory, which explores the dynamics of public opinion formation and the reasons behind individuals' willingness or reluctance to express their views openly. The theory posits that individuals are more likely to remain silent when they perceive their opinions to be in the minority, leading to a reinforcement of majority opinions and a suppression of minority views. This paper is pivotal to the research as it provides the theoretical framework for understanding how LLMs can contribute to the suppression of minority views and the amplification of majority opinions. I was drawn to this theory because it offers a powerful explanation for the dynamics of public opinion and the role of media in shaping public discourse, which is highly relevant in the context of AI and LLMs.},
