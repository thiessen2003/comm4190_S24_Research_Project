	abstract = {In this proposal, the authors outline the goals and research agenda for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, held in 1956. The project brought together leading researchers in the field and is widely considered the birthplace of AI as a formal academic discipline. The proposal introduces key concepts and challenges in AI, such as natural language processing, machine learning, and reasoning. It also sets the stage for future developments in AI, including the creation of language models. This document is particularly important for the research as it provides historical context and highlights the early objectives and aspirations of the field.},
