	abstract = {The author explores the implications of computer technology on human reasoning and decision-making, arguing that the increasing reliance on computers can lead to a diminished capacity for human judgment and autonomy. The author draws on his experiences with the ELIZA program, an early natural language processing system, to illustrate the potential limitations and risks of AI technologies. Book is quite relevant to the paper as it provides a philosophical and ethical perspective on the relationship between humans and machines, which is essential when considering the impact of LLMs on society.},
