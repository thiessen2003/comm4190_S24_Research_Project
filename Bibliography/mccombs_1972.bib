	abstract = {The authors introduce the agenda-setting theory, which posits that media influences public opinion by determining which issues are most salient and worthy of attention. The authors conduct a study of the 1968 U.S. presidential election, showing a strong correlation between the issues emphasized in media coverage and the issues considered most important by voters. This paper is particularly relevant to the research as it highlights the role of media in shaping public discourse and setting the agenda for public opinion, which is essential when considering the impact of LLMs on public opinion formation. Also, it has a quite interesting, clear, and compelling demonstration of the power of media in influencing public priorities and perceptions, which is highly relevant in the age of AI and digital media.},
