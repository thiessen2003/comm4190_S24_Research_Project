	abstract = {The author provides a critical survey of bias in natural language processing (NLP), examining the various ways in which bias can manifest in NLP systems and the potential harms and power imbalances that can result. The authors discuss the limitations of current approaches to measuring and mitigating bias in NLP and call for a more holistic and socially informed approach to addressing these issues. This paper is particularly important to the research as it highlights the potential for NLP systems, including LLMs, to perpetuate and amplify biases present in the training data and the need for addressing these issues in the development and deployment of language technologies. Also, it has quite an interesting depth and nuance of this analysis, as it goes beyond simplistic notions of bias to consider the complex social and political dynamics at play in the design and use of NLP systems, which is essential for developing more equitable and responsible AI technologies.},
