	abstract = {In this work, Turing, the author, introduces the famous "Turing Test," a thought experiment designed to assess a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. The paper explores the question, "Can machines think?" and lays the groundwork for future research in AI. This paper is essential to the research as it provides a foundation for understanding the goals and challenges of creating intelligent machines that can process and generate human-like language.},
