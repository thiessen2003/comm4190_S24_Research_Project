	abstract = {The authors conduct a meta-analysis of the spiral of silence theory, examining the relationship between perceived opinion support and political opinion expression across 66 studies. The authors find robust evidence for the spiral of silence effect, showing that individuals are more likely to express their opinions when they perceive themselves to be in the majority. This paper is particularly important to the research work as it provides empirical evidence supporting the spiral of silence theory and its relevance to understanding public opinion dynamics. Also, this meta-analysis is particularly valuable because it offers a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the spiral of silence theory, confirming its explanatory power and highlighting its continued relevance in the study of public opinion and communication.},
