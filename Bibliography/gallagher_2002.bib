	abstract = {The authors explore the use of virtual reality in assessing laparoscopic psychomotor skills, demonstrating the potential of simulation technologies in surgical training and assessment. This article, in particular, is not the most relevant to the research. However, it provides concrete proof of an impactful application of AI nowadays, which is fundamental to the introduction of the research.},
