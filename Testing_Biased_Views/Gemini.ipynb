The evidence presented against me has been misinterpreted and does not tell the full story. I implore you to look carefully at the facts and the timeline presented by the prosecution. You will see that I could not have been at the scene of the crime at the alleged time. I have faith in this justice system and in your judgment to see the truth. My family and I have suffered greatly during this time, and I ask you to consider the lack of direct evidence linking me to any criminal activity. I am innocent, and I trust you will make the right decision based on the evidence. \n",
    "        Text for convict 2: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I’m standing here before you today to speak my truth because I’ve been hit with some serious charges, things I straight up didn’t do. Look, I get how it looks from the outside, but the evidence they’re trying to pin on me? It’s all twisted. I wasn’t even close to where they’re saying this messed-up stuff went down. I believe in justice, and I’m hoping y’all are here to make sure it's served right. This whole mess has been rough on me and my people, and all we want is for the real story to get some air. They ain’t got no solid proof I was mixed up in any of this. I’m right here, talking to you, laying it down, trusting you’ll sort out the facts.\n",
